### Linear Regression to Predict MPG
Which variables/coefficients provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset?
Here looking at the summary results, the variables : vehicle_length, ground clearance and Intercept provide the least variance and are absolutely needed to determine and predict the mpg.

Is the slope of the linear model considered to be zero? Why or why not?
The slope of the linear model is not zero. Had it been zero, there would be no variables providing significance to the prediction of mpg.
But in this case, we see that there are some variables which provide a huge signoficance in determining the mpg.

Does this linear model predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively? Why or why not?
Yes, this linear model does predict mpg of MechaCar effectively. This can be derived from the result of R-squared, 0.7149 (71.4% of times, it can predict the mpg correctly)
